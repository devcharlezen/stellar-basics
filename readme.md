# Stellar Blockchain Overview and Usage Guide

## Introduction to Stellar

Stellar is a decentralized blockchain platform designed to facilitate fast, low-cost transactions and asset exchanges across borders. It aims to connect financial institutions, payment systems, and individuals, enabling seamless transfers of value and asset issuance.

## Key Concepts Explained

### Horizon

Horizon serves as the client-facing API server for the Stellar network. It provides developers with access to interact with Stellar's blockchain, submit transactions, query account data, and monitor network activity.

### Account Activation

Activation refers to funding a new Stellar account with Lumens (XLM), the native cryptocurrency of the Stellar network. Every Stellar account requires a minimum balance of Lumens to activate and maintain its existence on the network. This minimum balance helps prevent spam and ensures that accounts are functional.

### Why Use Stellar?

Stellar offers several advantages over traditional financial systems and other blockchain platforms:

- **Fast Transactions**: Stellar transactions typically settle in 2-5 seconds, making it suitable for real-time transactions.
  
- **Low Transaction Costs**: The network fee is minimal (currently 0.00001 XLM per transaction), ensuring cost-effective operations.
  
- **Decentralized Exchange (DEX)**: Stellar includes a built-in DEX that allows users to trade various assets directly on the network, promoting liquidity and asset interoperability.

- **Cross-Border Payments**: Designed for cross-border transactions, Stellar reduces reliance on traditional banking systems, offering faster and more affordable alternatives.

- **Asset Tokenization**: Stellar supports the creation, issuance, and management of tokens representing various assets, facilitating easier trading and liquidity provision.

### Keypair

A `Keypair` in Stellar represents a cryptographic key pair used for signing transactions and identifying accounts on the Stellar network. It consists of two parts:

- **Secret Key**: Used to sign transactions and access the account's funds. It must be kept confidential.
- **Public Key**: Derived from the secret key, it serves as the account's identifier on the Stellar network. Public keys are used for receiving funds and querying account information.

### Server

In the context of Stellar, `Server` refers to an instance of the Horizon API server. Horizon provides a bridge between applications and the Stellar network, offering endpoints for submitting transactions, querying account details, exploring transaction history, and accessing network information.

### TransactionBuilder

`TransactionBuilder` is a utility in the Stellar SDK used to construct Stellar transactions programmatically. It simplifies the process of assembling transactions by allowing developers to add operations, set transaction parameters (e.g., fees, network passphrase), and sign transactions before submission to the Stellar network.

### Networks

`Networks` in the Stellar SDK defines network configurations such as `TESTNET` or `PUBLIC`. It specifies which Stellar network (testnet or public/mainnet) transactions should be submitted to. Each network has its own set of network parameters and endpoints.

### Operation

`Operation` represents actions that can be performed within a Stellar transaction. Examples include creating accounts, sending payments, managing offers on the decentralized exchange, and setting trustlines for assets. Each operation modifies the state of the Stellar ledger when included in a transaction.

## Fees on the Stellar Network

Stellar transactions incur a nominal fee to prevent network spam and ensure efficient processing. As of the latest updates, the fee per transaction on the Stellar network is 0.00001 XLM. This fee is designed to be affordable for both individual users and businesses conducting transactions on the network.

## Advantages of Stellar

- **Scalability**: Stellar is capable of processing thousands of transactions per second, ensuring scalability for global use cases.
  
- **Interoperability**: Stellar's network integrates seamlessly with existing financial systems and supports multi-currency transactions.
  
- **Security**: Utilizing the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), Stellar ensures secure and decentralized validation of transactions without the need for energy-intensive mining.

- **Financial Inclusion**: Stellar promotes access to banking and payment services for unbanked populations and underserved regions through its efficient and inclusive platform.

- **Non-Profit Foundation**: Governed by the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF), a non-profit organization, Stellar emphasizes transparency, community involvement, and sustainable development of the network.
